My Twine project is from the perspective of you as a farmer on a Tudor monastary farm in Tudor England. It explores you making decisions as you go about your day feeding the animals, sheering sheep and repairing things, with everything seeming normal until you realize something is amiss. 
Someone is stealing the horses and when you investigate, you find out that the farm's owner is responsible for the thefts. But when you confront him, he has you imprisoned, where you tragically are unable to leave.
